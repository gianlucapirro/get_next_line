# get_next_line

A C function that will read the next line of a file

you will probably never use this function if you are not from the 42 Network. The goal of this project is to get better at understanding how C works and to get used to working with file descriptors and static variables. For this project you can only use three standard functions:

∙ read <br>
∙ malloc <br>
∙ free <br>

#### You can try this function out by:

    ∙ cloning this project: git clone https://github.com/gianlucapirro/get_next_line.git gnl
    ∙ include the get_next_line.h file: #include "path/to/get_next_line.h"
    ∙ compile your files including the get_next_line.c and get_next_line_utils.c: gcc get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c
